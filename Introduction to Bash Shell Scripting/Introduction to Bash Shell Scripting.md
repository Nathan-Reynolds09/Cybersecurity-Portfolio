## Introduction to Bash Shell Scripting

In this project I will learn several Bash shell commands that will allow me to navigate and use the shell for everyday tasks. The project objectives are:
* Navigating file directories
* Viewing, editing, creating, deleting, and renaming files on the command line and with text editing tools
* Finding information about files, logs, command history, and file paths
* Editing user aliases to personalize the environment
* Creating a script to back up the user directory
* Automating scripts with cron

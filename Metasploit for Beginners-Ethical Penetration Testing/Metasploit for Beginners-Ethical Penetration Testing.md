# Metasploit for Beginners: Ethical Penetration Testing
In this project I will learn the key tools and techniques needed to conduct ethical hacking and penetration testing. The goals of this project are:
* Utilize an exploit using Metasploit to gain access to a vulnerable system
* Perform a Vulnerability Scan Analysis to enable effective vulnerability reporting
* Author comprehensive penetration testing reports with results that will enable a company to fix their vulnerabilities

There are some pre-requisite steps to take in order to complete this project
1. Download VMWare [Download for Windows and Linux](https://www.vmware.com/products/desktop-hypervisor/workstation-and-fusion)
2. Upload Kali Linuz Virtual Machine to VMWare [Download for Kali Linux Virtual Machine](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines)
3. Upload the Metaploitable2 Machine to VMWare [Download for Metasploit2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/) [Walkthrough for Metaploitable2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRgCop4jkk)
4. Connect the Boxes in VMWare so They Can Ping Each Other [Guide](https://www.ubackup.com/enterprise-backup/how-to-connect-one-virtual-machine-to-another.html)
